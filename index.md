# Vanshika's First CS193 Homework

WHAT I LOVE ABOUT CS 193:
- The laidback style of the course which makes it less intimidating.
- The fact that the TA's can relate to us and have reliable advice to help us be successful.
- The grading of the course is straight forward and low stress.
- The content of the course is interesting and helpful!
